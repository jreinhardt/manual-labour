Manual Labour
=============

Manual Labour is a tool that makes it easy to create beautiful and practical
step-by-step instructions. It is based on an expressive plain text format that is
read- and writeable by humans and can export the finished instructions into a
number of formats. Although intended to be integrated with other tools, it is
useful on its own.
