Welcome to Manual Labour's documentation!
=========================================

Manual labour is a library that provides data structures and algorithms to
represent and manipulate step-by-step instructions.

Especially in the Open Hardware community the proper documentation of
projects is a big bottleneck that severly limits reproducability, knowledge
transfer, reusability of components, modularity and complexity of feasible
projects.

Manual labour tries to improve the situation by providing a solid conceptual basis and the necessary data structures and algorithms upon which tools for a specific purpose can be built.
